title: Why I removed my old posts

As you may have noticed, there are less articles than there were before.

I decided I wanted to remove the longer tutorial posts I had because I am simply not interested in making that longer content and will be transitioning to primarily shorter "quick tips/opinion" types of posts instead. I am at a point where id prefer to have this be as simple as possible to write new stuff so I would rather just use github markdown than something like prismic moving forward for content. Converting them is too wonky with the HTML that prismic generates unfortunately, I don't feel like dealing with it.

With this new era, I will be doing a weekly series called quick tips, where I will be sharing one tip I learned each week or so with a new post. use the `/feed` url to subscribe via rss
