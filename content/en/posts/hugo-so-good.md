I think I finally enjoy having a blog in practice the way I enjoyed it in theory in my head when I would be like taking a shower or driving in traffic or something. You can choose between such an absurd amount of options and templates and the integration with vercel has ci/cd auto set up for me at no cost. It's so good this literally sounds like an ad but it's not, you can choose to believe me or not I guess. I'll probably make fun of pascal case less in the future as a result of this one, good work hugo, whoever you are.
